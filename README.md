# rocker-bot

Rocker is a slack bot. It shows calendar of rock-band's concerts and rock events in the cities.

![rocker bot](https://github.com/austinov/rocker-bot/blob/assets/screenshot.gif)

In the beginning, as usual, run:
```
    $ go get github.com/austinov/go-recipes
```

To run the rocker with the Docker use the script run-in-docker.sh.
Before running the script set token value of bot user in bot.yaml.
```
	$ cd github.com/austinov/go-recipes
	$ ./rocker-bot/run-in-docker.sh
```

The script creates two containers - first for PostgreSQL, second for the bot.
The loader uses the [www.concerts-metal.com](http://www.concerts-metal.com/) to load events.
With the current settings (in bot.yaml) the entire calendar is downloaded and available within the hour.
You can play with the settings of num-loaders and num-savers in bot.yaml.

To run the bot without using the Docker, create database structure with ./go-recipes/rocker-bot/sql/re-create-db
and specify the connection string to your PostgreSQL in bot.yaml and just run:
```
	$ cd github.com/austinov/go-recipes
	$ glide up
	$ cd ./rocker-bot
	$ go run main.go -config ./bot.yaml
```

To communicate with the bot you can use the following notation:

- to print help:
```
	@rocker help
```

- to list events of band:
```
	@rocker events of Metallica
```

- to list events in city:
```
	@rocker events in Paris
```

	@rocker events in London at 22.05.2017
